# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs.

The pong game is made using SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) and Javascript along with basic HTML and CSS. The game is played with 2 players, each controlling the movement of the paddles using keys. A score counter keeps track of the score to determine the winner.

## Stretch Goal Achieved

When either player 1 or player 2 reaches 5 points, the game is over and the "GAME OVER" text appears on the board. 

## Learning Objectives Achieved:

1. The most interesting tool I learned during this project were SVGs. I enjoyed creating designs using HTML. It challenged me to incorporate CSS transformations into SVGs to provide interactivity.

2. The pong game project also gave me an opportunity to familiarize myself with EcmaScript 2015. Although it would require more knowledge and practice, however, this project was a helpful introduction.

3. The project also provided an opportunity to learn, practice and implement tools like Babel and Webpack.

4. Finally, I learned how to incorporate screenshots of my work into README.md.
